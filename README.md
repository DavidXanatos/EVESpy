# EVESpy
DLL Injection to take Screen Shots of EVE Online

Basically this set of projects allow you to inject a DLL into EVE online. I used it to generate screen shots of my travels to Jita every 
30 seconds. 

I then trained a haar OpenCV model to identify the 'yellow' gate.

### Further work required: 

* Clean up
* Refactoring and automation

Ideally this should all be automated to navigate automatically to the target system.
